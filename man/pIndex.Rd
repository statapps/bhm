\title{
Probability Index for Survival Time Difference
}
\description{
\{pIndex\} is a function to estimate and test differce of survival time among groups.
It is defined as p = Pr\{T_1 < T_2 \}, where $T_1$ is survival time for subjects in 
group 1 and $T_2$ is surval time in group 2.
}

\usage{
pIndex(x, ...)

\method{pIndex}{formula}(formula, data, control = list(...),...)
###To estimate probability index for treatment and control groups (define by trt):
#
# fit = pIndex(Surv(time, status) ~ trt)
#
###To estimate probability index difference for treatment and control 
###groups (define by trt) between biomarker postive and biomarker negative
###subjects(i.e. Treatment-biomarker interaction):
#
# fit = pIndex(Surv(time, status) ~ trt+biomarker)
#
}

\arguments{
  \item{formula}{an object of class "formula"(or one that can be coerced to that class): a sy
mbolic description of the model to be fitted. 
  The details of model specification are given under 'Details'.}

  \item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by 
'as.data.frame' to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. 
If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the enviro
nment from which pIndex is called.}

  \item{x}{Here covariate x is a design matrix of dimension n * 1 (for two sample test) 
or dimension n * 2 (for treatment * biomarker interaction).}

  \item{control}{a list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. 
See 'pIndexControl' for details} 

  \item{\dots}{additional arguments to be passed to the low level regression fitting 
functions (see below).}  
}

\details{
pIndex(y~x) will estimate probability index of two groups (eg. treatment vs control) define by x. 
pIndex(y~x1 + x2) will estimate the difference of probability index of x1 (eg. treatment vs control)
between biomarker positive and biomarker negative groups (x2).
Function print(x) can be used to print a summary of pIndex results.
}

\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
pIndex returns an object of class inheriting from "pIndex". 
When B > 0, an object of class "pIndex" is a list containing at least the following components:
  \item{theta}{the estimated probability index}  
  \item{theta.b}{Bootstrap or Jackknife sample of the probability index}
  \item{sd}{standard deviation of theta based on resampling}
  \item{ci}{(1-alpha) percent confidence interval based on resampling}
}
